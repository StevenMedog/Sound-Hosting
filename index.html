    New Adelphi Theatre
    Event: Tarot: Shuffle

    Berk’s Nest in association with PBJ Management present TAROT: SHUFFLE The best show of 2019 according to Chortle. The sixth-best show of 2022 according to the Guardian. Come watch us continue our slow descent into mediocrity. They (our parents, partners, children) say 'sketch is dead', but if it's dead then where's all our money going? Joyously silly and uproariously live and in-the-room, we would call it improv but we’ve got some self-respect: this is sketch in nighties. Come watch a new tour of big, daft and, above all, live comedy being conjured up in front of your very eyes. 'Bark-out-loud funny... the whole show is startlingly live' ★★★★ Guardian 'One of the balls-out funniest show of the Fringe' ★★★★½ Chortle 'Tarot will not give you nightmares, though you might wake laughing your head off' ★★★★ Evening Standard ★★★★ Telegraph Photo credit: Matt Stronge WARNINGS: Suitable for ages 16+. Contains strong language & adult themes throughout. ADMISSION: £16 / £14 - https://bit.ly/tarotshuffle
